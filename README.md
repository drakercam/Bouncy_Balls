# Description
This is a simple rendering project for bouncing balls I created using C++ and raylib. Once again I'm sticking to my more procedural, 'C-like' programming I enjoy doing while using C++ functionality. Feel free to use and alter any of the source code, I also have included my defs.h header file which defines many different shape types according to the arguments required to draw many 2D and 3D shapes in raylib.
